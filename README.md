# 📝 Notes App – Flutter Note-Taking Application

Notes App is a clean and minimal note-taking application built with Flutter.
It allows users to add, edit, and delete notes with a smooth UI and efficient state management using BLoC.

This project was developed as part of my Flutter learning journey, focusing on clean architecture, reusable widgets, and scalable code practices.
